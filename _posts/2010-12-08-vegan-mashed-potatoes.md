excerpt: Some delicious vegan mashed potatoes
---

**Ingredients**:
* Russet potatoes
* Red potatoes
* Soy milk
* Organic Vegan Margarine
* Garlic powder
* Chili powder
* Paprika
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Sea salt

I wanted to eat something really healthy last night. I love mashed potatoes, but I knew I didn't want to use cream and butter to make them, since I've been eating healthier things lately (for the past 6 months). 

So, I went food shopping, and I got a few potatoes. I couldn't decide which kind to use, since different potatoes give you different textures. So I said, let's experiment! I bought red and russet potatoes. Since I was going to be experimenting on just myself, I used two red potatoes and one russet one. I skinned them, chopped them up in roughly 3/4 inch side cubes and cooked them. Once the potatoes were cooked, I used my trusty potato masher. Then, I added about one spoonful and a half of organic vegan margarine and about half a cup (maybe less) of soy milk. Stirred. Added sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika and chili powder. 

These were some good mashed potatoes!
